Creating a Culture that Emphasizes and Reinforce Staff Worth, (1.5 hrs.) Transforming an Organizational Culture begins with a conversation about what a culture of value might look like. What would be different? What would be retained? A culture that emphasizes the value of its staff is both a top down process that needs endorsement from the Executive level as well as an alluring new organizational vision. This new vision should invite and inspire heartfelt 'buy in' from a critical mass off employees who will spread their enthusiasm. The goal involves communication and support as every employee is involved in a cultural transition that must reconcile the delicate balance between staff accountability and employee worth both as valued staff -and as individuals.
