PSY212
The Psychology of Gender
The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the discipline assessing the behavior and thought patterns of women and men. Issues revelant to the Psychology of Gender include: how gender identity develops, the role of both biological and social entities in creating the psychological components of gender, the media's damaging role in the sustenance of gender sterotypes, the role of gender in mental illnesses, and women's evolving social roles and their impact on relationships and children. These issues are prevalent in students' personal and professional lives, but they are usually not examined on a theoretical level. Gender issues are an important topic in psychology because different social roles create a unique psychology relevant to both women and men.
