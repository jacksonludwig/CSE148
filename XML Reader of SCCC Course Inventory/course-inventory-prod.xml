        <CourseLongTitle>Search for Life in the Universe</CourseLongTitle>
        <CourseDescription>This course explores the question of whether or not life exists elsewhere in the Universe. An
            interdisciplinary approach will be taken using concepts from astronomy, physics, chemistry, and biology to
            explore the likelihood of life developing beyond Earth. In addition, the course will focus on recent/current
            developments concerning space expeditions designed to seek out possible forms of life on other worlds in our
            solar system. Sociological and philosophical viewpoints on the topic of life forming in other parts of the
            Universe will be discussed. Students will be expected to perform elementary mathematics, think critically,
            acquire and interpret data, present original thoughts/opinions in both oral and written form. The scientific
            method will be the cornerstone of the course's endeavors to demonstrate how to use scientifically
            established facts as the basis for the search for life beyond Earth Note: Fulfills SUNY General Education
            Requirement for Natural Sciences. (3 hrs. lecture, 2 hrs. laboratory) Prerequisite: MAT007 or equivalent.

        <CourseDescription>Module 1: Introduction to Pedagogy Online Learning

            In order for online learning to be successful, teachers as well as learners must take on new roles in the
            teaching-learning relationship, and faculty must be willing to release control of learning to the students.
            Online learning environments permit a full range of interactive methodologies, and instructors have found
            that in adapting their courses to online models, they are paying more attention to the instructional design
            of their courses. We will review the steps for best practice as they design their course(s).

        <CourseLongTitle>The Philosophy of Animal Rights and Welfare</CourseLongTitle>
        <CourseDescription>The relationship between humans and animals is rich and complex. For the past several
            decades, philosophers have been exploring the ethical dimensions to this relationship. What moral duties do
            we have to nonhuman animals? Do animals possess "rights"? Are the various ways in which animals are
            exploited morally defensible, or do our attitudes towards animals reveal inconsistencies in our moral
            framework? This class will survey the philosophical arguements that have been offered in the debate
            surrounding these questions, and encourage the students to participate in the debate by forming and
            defending their own positions. Note: Fulfills SUNY General Education Requirement for Humanities. No

        <CourseDescription>Investigates progress of human development throughout adulthood and later life, primarily
            from psychological perspective. Although most of human lifespan is spent as an adult, developmental
            psychology courses, because of time constraints, either stop at adolescence or give short shrift to what
            follows it. This course enables students to understand psychological as well as sociological and
            anthropological aspects of the process of becoming an adult and aging. Note: Credit give for PSY211 or
            SOC220, but not both. Prerequisite: PSY101. Offered on: A / 3 cr. hrs.

        <CourseLongTitle>The Psychology of Gender</CourseLongTitle>
        <CourseDescription>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the discipline assessing the behavior
            and thought patterns of women and men. Issues revelant to the Psychology of Gender include: how gender
            identity develops, the role of both biological and social entities in creating the psychological components
            of gender, the media's damaging role in the sustenance of gender sterotypes, the role of gender in mental
            illnesses, and women's evolving social roles and their impact on relationships and children. These issues
            are prevalent in students' personal and professional lives, but they are usually not examined on a
            theoretical level. Gender issues are an important topic in psychology because different social roles create
            a unique psychology relevant to both women and men. This course will enhance students' critical thinking
            skills and provide an interdisciplinary forum to critique contexts and see the role of gender in our
            psychological health. Note: Fulfills SUNY General Education Requirement for Social Sciences. (offered spring

        <CourseDescription>Creating a Culture that Emphasizes and Reinforce Staff Worth, (1.5 hrs.)

            Transforming an Organizational Culture begins with a conversation about what a culture of value might look
            like. What would be different? What would be retained? A culture that emphasizes the value of its staff is
            both a top down process that needs endorsement from the Executive level as well as an alluring new
            organizational vision. This new vision should invite and inspire heartfelt 'buy in' from a critical mass off
            employees who will spread their enthusiasm. The goal involves communication and support as every employee is
            involved in a cultural transition that must reconcile the delicate balance between staff accountability and
            employee worth both as valued staff -and as individuals.

        <CourseDescription>Recognizing Your Staff (1.5 hrs.)

            Recognition is one of the most motivating actions that someone can offer. Yet this ostensibly simple skill
            is more instinctive for some than others. Learn how to recognize your diverse staff through small but
            powerful actions. Look for ‘teachable moment’ Simple words of praise, listening to others and including them
            in events and meetings are actions of recognition that take a little bit of time, but go a long way. Learn
            ways to recognize your staff with the resources that you have. All employees must rightfully believe that
            their ideas matter. While not everyone can sit at the decision table, all employees should know that their
            suggestion have been heard, carefully considered and represented. Effective communication is imperative as
            everyone in the organization will need to share accurately the news about the improved culture. This program
            will discuss the importance of a paradigm shift involving everyone as they consider and reconsider
            expectations within this new culture and reflect upon existing organizational structure and work systems.

        <CourseDescription>We improve our well-being when we learn to fully use our bodies. Ordinarily, we learn just
            enough to function. For example, we learn to use our hands well enough to eat, our legs to walk. The
            Feldenkrais Method teaches through movement how we can improve our capabilities to function in our daily
            lives. The Feldenkrais Practitioner will verbally guide you through a sequence of movements while lying on
            the floor. You will discover how you do the movements and notice the quality of changes in your body. You
            will develop awareness, flexibility and coordination. Students should wear loose clothing and bring a mat.
